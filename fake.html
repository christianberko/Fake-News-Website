            <h2>How is Fake News Used</h2>
            <br>
            
            <p> Fake news is not new, but ever since the 2020 election, it became a big issue.  
                According to an analysis released by NewsGuard websites that provide “unreliable news” increased their share of social media interactions this year.
                In 2019, 8 percent of engagement with the 100 top-performing news sources on social media was dubious. In 2020, that number more than doubled to 17 percent. 
                NewsGuard rates news sites according to their reliability, and it found that more people were engaging on these sites than the previous year.

                Due to the pandemic, there was an increased amount of people online due to the plethora of time people were spending in their homes. 
                Social media platforms create information bubbles, which are extremely dangerous.  
                
                Objectivity begins to get lost the further down the rabbit hole you go. 
                Conspiracy theories and misinformation run rampant on social media because these companies do not have the proper measures put in place to counter act this.  
                This has created a divide where people on both ends of the political spectrum can barely agree on basic facts, which is extremely problematic. 
                Some may argue that more right leaning content is what is being censored or removed. Former President Donald Trump often criticized tech companies for having biased
                censorship and even attempted to rid of Section 230, which is a law that allow social media companies to police their platforms however they want. However, social media algorithms are biased 
                toward content that would produce emotional reactions and that people are likely to share.
