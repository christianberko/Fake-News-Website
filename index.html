        <p>
            Misleading and Fake News are a growing problem in our society today.  While not interchangeable, the term fake news is usually associated with politics, and this association often narrows down the focus of the issue.  When people talk about fake news, it is assumed that they are talking about political news stories.  Misleading information can be defined as the range of misinformation and disinformation on topics like, breaking news, health, environmental, and economics on all platforms.  
            Many of the things you read online, and on social media appear to be factual but often they aren’t.  This false information is created to deliberately misinform and deceive readers.  The stories are meant to influence people’s views, push political agendas, or just to cause confusion. Another reason false information is created is make money through clickbait content, the more clicks a fake story gets the money online publishers make through advertising revenue. 
             Social media is a hub for this, since it drives so much web traffic, the more controversial or outrageous the content is, the more interaction from users it will get, which means it will be shared and possibly go viral.   Sometimes stories aren’t even false, but they have misleading titles that get more people to click on them in order to spread quickly. Nowadays, news comes in the form of small snippets of the full article and short videos that recap the news, 
             so all it takes is a juicy title and someone will click on it.  </p>
             
        <p>In the past, news came from media outlets and journals that were required to follow strict codes of practice, which meant that there was an established level of trust in the news you received.  But the creation of the internet generated a new way to share, publish and consume information with almost no regulations.  Our news today comes from social media sites and networks that have practically no editorial process. 
             As a result, this opens these platforms to misleading information that can be made to look like information from trusted sites using similar names, colors, and web addresses.  In addition, the average person’s knowledge of how the internet works has exponentially made the problem worse.

            <p>Imposter Content: This is when genuine sources are impersonated with fake made up sources. 
                 This is dangerous because it involves the presentation of unfounded material in the shape of a reputable news source or article to give it the appearance of coming from a reliable source.</p>

            <p>Sloppy Journalism: Journalists may publish stories that contain unreliable information or zero fact checking on their own writing,
                    which can mislead the reader.  For example, the fashion company Urban Outfitters released an Election Day Guide during the U.S. elections, which featured inaccurate information stating that voters required a "voter registration card."
                    No state in the United States requires this in order to vote.</p>
