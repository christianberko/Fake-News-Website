              <p> 1. Check the source of the story:</p>
                   
                <p>Is it a credible/ reliable source? If you are unfamiliar with the author or site.
                Do a little bit of digging to see if the author is known or has other articles written. </p>
                <br>

                <p>	2. Donâ€™t just look at the headline:</p>
                <p>Many fake news stories use shocking headlines to grab attention. 
                    Look through the entire article to see if the headings are in all caps or contain exclamation points. </p>

                <p> 3. Check other Sources:</p>
                <p>Are other reputable news outlets reporting on the story? Also check the sources of the article itself, 
                    and see if they are credible/exist. </p>
                    <br>

                <p>4. Fact Check!:</p>
                <p>Fake news stories usually have incorrect dates or altered timelines.  
                    So,check when the article was published, is it a current or an old story?</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                
                <p> 5. Our own Bias: </p>
                <img src = "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/02/A_Feb22_07_1310031204.jpg" class = "right "alt = "fact check headline">    
                <p>Media algorithms are designed to give us news that aligns with out beliefs.  
                This is dangerous because if you come across fake news that aligns with your world view and confirms your beliefs on a certain topic, you may read that story and take it as fact.  
                Imagine this on large scale, people consuming fake news and then spreading that news as fact. We must be aware of our own views and beliefs because they can affect our judgment of how reliable a piece of information is.
