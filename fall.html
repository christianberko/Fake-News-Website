                <li> <p>Social Media collects and presents news stories from a variety of outlets regardless of the reliability or political bias contained in the story.
                      Manipulators can easily get their bogus news onto media outlets if the reputation of the original publisher is not known. Without detailed fact-checking, which most people don't do, 
                      it is difficult for readers to assess a story's honesty if they can't easily tell who authored it or contributed the material.</p>
                </li>
   
                <li>
                    <p>Since many news stories are read through social media via a friend or people they follow along with likes and sharing.  
                        People trust these stories because they are shared and sent to them by friends or sent to group chats.  It is also human nature, we are a lazy people who usually don't take the time to validate the information that we look at.
                        You are looking at what you think is the trusted source you have been using daily, so you don't bat an eye at anything that could look suspiscious. Coupled with the fact that there are so many different news outlets, it can make it
                        very easy for online manipulators to trick people.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Social Media Algorithms automatically tag articles with high popularity metrics (likes, shares, and views)
                        which make people more likely to interact with a story that has high metrics.</p>
